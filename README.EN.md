`master` branch preview is on Netlify here: https://design-vue-kit.netlify.com/

## Intro

**Design Vue kit** is a set of Vue components that implements [Bootstrap Italia](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/) and [Design UI Kit](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit) styling, as [shown on InVision](https://invis.io/TWMUZS6VFP5).

Components are showcased with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Public version of Storybook (built from `master` branch) is available here: https://italia.github.io/design-vue-kit.

### Requirements

* NodeJS
* Npm

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run `npm run storybook` to start the development server.
A script takes care of running the `npm install` command needed to install dependencies.

Storybook will therefore be available at http://localhost:6006

Public version of the Storybook is available [here](https://italia.github.io/design-vue-kit).

## How to create new components

This section explains how to create new components in the repository.
All components reside in the `components` directory: each component is a folder with all that is needed to make it work. *Storybook* stories are instead under `stories`.

i.e. the `Button` component is shown below the `src/components/Button` path and its structure is as follows:

```
src
    └── components
        └── Button
            ├── Button.vue
stories
    └── Button
        ├── Button.stories.js
```

Some basic rules for structuring the components:

* VUE file component files use VUE syntax.
* The `.stories.js` files only restore the relative component only.

Once you have created a new component, with its history, starting *Storybook* will be able to check that everything works as it should.

### Storybook

Storybook has been enriched with some `addons` that make it more talented. Check dependencies on the `package.json` file for details.

## Publishing

A command is available to reach a static version of the Storybook catalog as it can be deployed without using a webserver.

```sh
$ npm run build-storybook
```

Static pages obtained from the compilation process generate under the `storybook-static` directory.

### Package

To use Design Vue as a dependency in an app you can install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~italia):

```sh
$ npm install design-vue-kit
```

So it imports and uses the component:

```jsx
<template>
    <Alert>
        Questo è un alert
    </Alert>
</template>

<script>
import { Alert } from "design-vue-kit";

export default {
    data() {
        return {

        }
    },
    components: {
        Alert
    }
}
</script>

<style>
</style>
```

#### Peer dependencies

The library does not include `vue` , avoiding versions clashing and increasing the size of the bundle.
For this reason, for local development it will be necessary to manually install dependencies.

The command to be executed is
```sh
$ yarn install --peers
```
or alternatively manually
```sh
$ yarn install vue
```

#### CSS styles

The library is composed of a part of the states, inherited from the [bootstrap-italia](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/) package, that can be imported and installed with the following:

```sh
$ npm install bootstrap-italia
```

A second part of the package, and its actions, are directly imported from the same CSS generated:

```js
import "bootstrap-italia/dist/css/bootstrap-italia.min.css";
```

#### Preprocessors

Having the preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) available, it will be possible to integrate (and customize) the sources of the same:

```scss
@import "bootstrap-italia/src/scss/bootstrap-italia.scss";
```
